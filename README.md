# My Resume

My resume created in LaTeX.

This resume is based on the [AltaCV template](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV).

I use XeLaTeX from TeX Live 2016 to create the final PDF file.

I have several color themes that I created for the resume which I like and I have
commented out the ones that are not in use in `main.tex`.
[LaTeX Color Definitions](http://latexcolor.com/) was a lovely resource.

One of the things I have tried to do is to hyperlink everything so that my resume
is more interactive, even if it is just a PDF file.
